# About this Guide

![](coverbild.jpg)

```{block,type='rmdinfo'}
This guide shows you how to conduct meta-analyses in R from scratch. The focus of this guide is primarily on clinical outcome research in psychology. It is designed for staff and collaborators of the [**PROTECT Lab**](https://www.protectlab.org), which is headed by **Dr. David D. Ebert**.

**The guide will show you how to:**
 
* Get **R** and **RStudio** set for your meta-analysis
* Get your data into R
* **Prepare your data** for the meta-analysis
* Perform **fixed-effect** and **random-effects** meta-analysis using the `meta` and `metafor`packages
* Analyse the **heterogeneity** of your results
* Tackle heterogeneity using **subgroup analyses** and **meta-regression**
* Check if **selective outcome reporting (publication bias)** is present in your data
* Control for selective outcome reporting and publication bias
* Analyse the **risk of bias** in your data
* Do advanced types of meta-analyses, such as 
    + **network analyses** or 
    + meta-analyses with **more than one outcome**

**What this guide will not cover**

Although this guide will provide some information on the statistics behind meta-analysis, it will not give you an **in-depth introduction** into how meta-analyses are calculated statistically.
  
It is also beyond the scope of this guide to advise in detail which meta-analytical strategy is suited best in which contexts, and on how the search, study inclusion and reporting of meta-analyses should be conducted. The [*Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions*](http://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/), however, should be a great source to find more information on these topics.

**Generally, there a two other sources to recommended when conducting Meta-Analyses:**
  
* If you're looking for a easily digestable, hands-on introduction on how Meta-Analyses are conducted, we can recommend **Pim Cuijpers' online courses on meta-analysis**. The courses are freely available on YouTube. To have a look, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP7_VBrG_TY&list=PL-h5cI5Bkvt0J-O0kq_9J9_aksWFPgR7s).
* If you're interested in more details on how to conduct meta-analyses in R, you can either have a look at Wolfgang Viechtbauer's page for the `metafor` package ([Link](http://metafor-project.org)). Or you can consult a book on the `meta` package which was recently published [@schwarzer2015meta].
