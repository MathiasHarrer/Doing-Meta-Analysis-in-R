# Reporting & Reproducibility

![](_figs/man-people-space-desk.jpg)

In the previous chapters, we covered various techniques, approaches and strategies we can use to conduct a meta-analysis in *R*. Nevertheless, the statistical procedures we covered in our guide only make up a **small proportion** of the entire meta-analysis process in real life. In meta-analysis projects "in the wild", it could happen that:

* You find an **error** in your meta-analysis *R* code, and therefore have to **replicate some steps** of your analysis with a few changes,
* Collaborators or reviewers suggest using a **different approach or model**, or performing a **sensitivity analysis** on your data,
* You want to **delegate** some parts of the analysis to one of your collaborators, and have to send her/him the current status of your analysis,
* You have to **stop working** on your project for some time, which means that you might forget some of the steps of your analysis before you return to the project,
* You want to **share results** of your analysis with project collaborators, but they may not know *R* and thus may not have RStudio installed.

These are just a few scenarios, but it should have become clear that creating a **reproducible work flow** when conducting meta-analyses in *R* is beneficial to both you and others. Aiming for reproducibility is also a cornerstone of **Open Science** practices. Making your meta-analysis fully reproducible creates complete transparency for other researchers concerning how you came to the results of your meta-analysis. **RStudio** is an optimal tool to create a reproducible workflow and facilitate cooperation on one project. Here, we will introduce two tools to reproduce, report and disseminate your analyses: [**R Markdown**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) and the [**Open Science Framework**](https://osf.io).

## R Projects

A good way to start with your analysis is to first set up an *R* project in RStudio. *R* projects create a new environment associated with one specific folder on your computer which contain all the data and *R* code you need for your analyses. Conducting your analyses in an *R* project means that all objects you create are **temporarily saved** in your project and will be accessible the next time you resume working on it. To create a new *R* project, you can click on the **"R project"** field in the upper-right corner of your RStudio window, and then on **"New Project..."** in the dropdown menu. 


```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.width=7, fig.height=2}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/MD1.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

You can then create a **New Directory**, a new folder on your computer, which will then become the working directory of your project. 


```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.height=4}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/MD2.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

Then, click on **"New Project"**.

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.height=4}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/MD3.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

I will give my new project the name **"Meta-Analysis Project"**. The project folder will be stored in my ~Documents/R folder.

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.height=4}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/MD4.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

After clicking **"Create Project"**, your *R* project is set. Under the **Files** tile in the lower-right pane of your RStudio window, you will see all data currently stored in your project folder. By clicking on **"New Folder"**, you can also create subfolders directly in RStudio, for example a folder containing all your data.

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.height=0.5}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/MD10.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

A great feature of *R* projects is that we do not have to **use absolute paths** to the files we want to reference or import. We only have to name the file name, or, if the file is in a subfolder, the subfolder name and the file name. For example, let us assume I have a dataset `data.xlsx` stored in my `data` subfolder. Using the `readxl` package, I can easily import the dataset by only specifying the "data" folder and the file name.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read_excel("data/data.xlsx")
```

It is also possible to save all objects listed in my upper-right **Environment** as an **R Data** (.rda) file in the project folder. Let us assume I have a `data.frame` called `dat` stored in my Global Environment. I can save this dataset in my `data` folder with this code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
save(dat, file = "data/dat.rda")
```

I can then load the data set back into my Global Environment again following the same logic:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
load("data/dat.rda")
```

## R Markdown

[**Markdown**](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a simple markup language for text formatting. **R Markdown** [@xie2018r] is an extension of Markdown, which makes it easy to combine plain text, *R* code, and the **output** of *R* code in one document. This makes R Markdown an extremely helpful tool to report our analyses. Using R Markdown we can create **HTML** or **PDF** files containing all **code** used in our analyses, the **output** we get from the code, and **detailed text** explaining what we did in each analysis step. It is very easy to build R Markdown files in RStudio. Simply click on the white symbol with the green plus sign in the upper-left corner of your RStudio window. Then, in the dropdown menu, click on **"R Markdown..."**.

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.height=4}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/MD5.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

After defining the name of your new R Markdown document, it should pop up in the upper-left corner of your window. 

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.height=5}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/MD6.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

The file already contains some exemplary content, which we can delete, except for the **first six lines**:

```
---
title: "Analysis"
author: "Mathias Harrer"
date: "10/16/2019"
output: html_document
---
```

This part is your so-called **YAML header**. It controls the **title**, **author**, **date** and **export format** of your document. The `output` format I chose for my document is `html_document`, meaning that the document will be exported as a HTML page once it is rendered. The structure of the R Markdown document consists of two parts: plain **Markdown text**, and so-called *R* chunks, shown in grey. We will not go into detail how the text parts in the R Markdown document are formatted, but this [**Cheat Sheet**](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) should be a great resource to start learning the Markdown syntax (this should only take about twenty minutes). The *R* code chunks, on the other hand, simply contain all the *R* code you would usually type into your Console. By clicking on the **"Insert"** field on the upper-right corner of the document, you can add new code chunks yourself.   

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.height=5}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/MD7.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

The code in the chunks works just like regular *R* code, except that the output is **not displayed in the Console or Plots pane**, but directly in the document. To run one of the chunks, you can click on the **little green triangle next to each chunk**.

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.height=0.5}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/MD8.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

Once we finished our document, we can export it as an HTML (or PDF, or MS Word document) by clicking on the **"Knit"** symbol in the upper-right corner. This will render the document, including all text, code, and ouput, and export it in the defined format. The finished document will automatically be saved in your project folder. 



```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.height=4}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/MD9.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

This has been an ultra-brief introduction into R Markdown, which contains much more functionality to explore. To learn more about R Markdown, you can consult the comprehensive [online guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

## OSF

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.height=1, fig.width=2}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/osf_black.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

The **Open Science Framework** ([OSF](www.osf.io)) is an open-source online platform to facilitate collaboration and reproducibility in research. The OSF includes an **online repository** on which researchers deposit their data and analysis scripts to collaborate and make all steps of the research process transparent. The OSF is a spearhead of the [Open Science](http://openscience.org/what-exactly-is-open-science/) movement, which has gathered much momentum in the last decade. We can encourage all meta-analysts to make their research and analysis process transparent to the public by providing open access to the collected data and *R* code used for the analyses. The OSF is a great tool to do this - all repositories you created for yourself are **private** by default, and it is up to you to decide if, when and what you want to make public. In the following, we will show you how to set up an **OSF repository** in *R*, **upload** and **download files**, and how to **add collaborators**.

### Access Token

To start using the OSF, you first have to create a **personal account** [here](www.osf.io). After your account has been created, we have to generate an **Access Token** so that we can manipulate our repository directly in RStudio. To get an access token, we can use this [link](https://osf.io/settings/tokens). On the site, click on **Create token**. 

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.height=4}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/OSF1.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

Then, under **Scopes**, check **all boxes**, and click on Create token again. After that, your personal access token should appear. Copy the token code and save it somewhere where only you can access it. 

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.height=4}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/OSF2.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

### Installing the `osfr` package & Authentication

To access OSF directly via *R*, we can use the `osfr` package [@osfr]. To install the package and load it from your library, use the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('osfr')
library(osfr)
```

Before I can start using the functionality of the `osfr` package, I have to use the access token to **authenticate**. This process is necessary so that only I (or everyone who has access to the token) can change something in my repository. To authenticate, we use the `osf_auth` function, providing it with the access token we just received (the token displayed below is made up and not my actual access token):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
osf_auth("AtmuMZ3pSuS7tceSMz2NNSAmVDNTzpm2Ud87PcqfHZPtG9U3NLHkRPSt4eE3zRb4")
```


### Setting up the repository

Using `osfr`, we can now initiate an online repository using *R* code. Let us assume that I am working on a new meta-analysis project, for which I want to upload my data and R Markdown script to an OSF repository, which I want to name "Meta-Analysis Project". To create a project on [osf.io](www.osf.io), I can use the `osf_create_project` function. I only have to plug in the name of the repository I want to create, and save it as an `R` object called `meta_analysis_project`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
meta_analysis_project <- osf_create_project("Meta-Analysis Project")
```

Using the `osf_open` function, I can then access my newly created repository online:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
osf_open(meta_analysis_project)
```


```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.height=4}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/OSF3.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

Now that my repository has been created, I can proceed by adding **components** to it, which function like folder do on my computer. I want to create two components, one for my datasets, and one for my R Markdown scripts. To do this, I use the `osf_create_component` function. I have to provide the function with the *R* object for my repository (`meta_analysis_project`), and then set the title of the component. I save both components as objects into my *R* environment.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
scripts <- osf_create_component(meta_analysis_project, title = "Analysis Scripts")
datasets <- osf_create_component(meta_analysis_project, title = "Datasets")
```

If I go to the online page of my repository now, I see that the two components have been added.

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.height=2, fig.width=3}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/OSF4.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

### Upload & Download

To upload data to the OSF repository, I can use the `osf_upload` function. The function requires the component/folder to which I want to add the file (as the *R* object we saved previously), and the **path to the file** as input. Let us say that I want to upload an R Markdown script "Analysis.rmd", which is currently saved in my *R* project subfolder "scripts". To upload, the I can use the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
osf_upload(scripts, "scripts/Analysis.rmd")
```

To see if the file has been uploaded successfully, I can access contents of the `scripts` components using the `osf_ls_files` function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
osf_ls_files(scripts)
```

```
# A tibble: 2 x 3
  name            id                       meta            
  <chr>           <chr>                    <list>          
1 Analysis.rmd    1db74s7bfcf91f0012567572l <named list [3]>

```

Is can been seen in the output, the **upload was successful**. To download a file, I can select a **row** from the `osf_ls_files` function output, and use this as input to the `osf_download` function to download this specific file back into the project folder on my computer.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
osf_download(osf_ls_files(scripts)[1,])
```


### Collaboration & Public Access

On the website of my OSF repository, I can also add **collaborators** under the **"Contributors"** field.

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.height=3}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/OSF5.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

At any time, I can also make my repository **public** by clicking on **Make Public** in the upper-right corner of the site.


```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.height=2, fig.width=4}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("_figs/OSF6.png")
grid.raster(img)
```
