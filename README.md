<a href="https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/" target="_blank"><img src="images/cover.png" width="250" align="right" alt="" class="cover" /></a> Welcome to the GitHub repository of <a href="https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/" target="_blank"><strong>"Doing Meta-Analysis with R: A Hands-On Guide"</strong></a>.

This book serves as an accessible introduction into how meta-analyses can be conducted in _R_. Essential steps for meta-analysis are covered, including pooling of outcome measures, forest plots, heterogeneity diagnostics, subgroup analyses, meta-regression, methods to control for publication bias, risk of bias assessments and plotting tools. 

Advanced, but highly relevant topics such as network meta-analysis, multi-/three-level meta-analyses, Bayesian meta-analysis approaches, SEM meta-analysis are also covered. 

The programming and statistical background covered in the book are kept at a **non-expert level**. A **print version** of this book has been published with [Chapman & Hall/CRC Press](https://www.routledge.com/Doing-Meta-Analysis-with-R-A-Hands-On-Guide/Harrer-Cuijpers-Furukawa-Ebert/p/book/9780367610074) (Taylor & Francis).

## Cite the Packages 

---

In the guide, we present and use various _R_ packages. The reason why all of us can use these packages for free is because experts all around the world have devoted enormous time and effort to their development, typically without pay. If you use some of the packages mentioned in this book for your own meta-analysis, we strongly encourage you to also cite them in your report. 

In the guide, every time a new package is introduced, we also provide the reference through which it can be cited. It is also possible to run `citation("package")` to retrieve the preferred reference. Thanks!
